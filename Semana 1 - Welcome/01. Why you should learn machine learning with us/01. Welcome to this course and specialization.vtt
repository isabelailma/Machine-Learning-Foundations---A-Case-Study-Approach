2
00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.423
Welcome to the machine
learning specialization and

3
00:00:06.423 --> 00:00:09.210
this first course on the fundamentals
of machine learning.

4
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.290
We're really excited to embark
on this journey with you.

5
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.710
Happy?

6
00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:14.280
>> We are.

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.640
Are you going to say who you are?

8
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:16.970
>> Oh, I'm Carlos.

9
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.460
>> And I'm Emily.

10
00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.320
>> And together, we're going to learn
about applications of machine learning,

11
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.180
how to build machine learning systems, and
how the algorithms behind them work, and

12
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.146
how to build those algorithms.

13
00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:28.952
Algorithms.

14
00:00:28.952 --> 00:00:33.760
>> [LAUGH] We're clearly just so excited
about this course and this specialization.

15
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.540
We can bearly put the words
together to describe it.

16
00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.020
>> So, let's get going.
