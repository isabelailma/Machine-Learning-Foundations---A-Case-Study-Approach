2
00:00:04.067 --> 00:00:09.395
So next, we're going to inspect
some columns of our data set.

3
00:00:09.395 --> 00:00:15.921
So let me, let's inspect some

4
00:00:15.921 --> 00:00:21.195
columns of the data set.

5
00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.310
So let's take a look at it.

6
00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.950
So if I type sf['Country'],

7
00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.950
what it's gonna do is select
a column country, and

8
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.060
since I don't do anything to it,
I don't set it equal to anything.

9
00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.350
It's just going to print it.

10
00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.580
Now, it says United States,
Canada, England, USA, Poland,

11
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.930
United States, Switzerland.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.630
So, that's the whole column,
but printed horizontally.

13
00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.683
Now, let's look at another column.

14
00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:06.064
So, for example,
let's look at the column age, so, sf.age.

15
00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:08.095
I'm just gonna look at it.

16
00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:12.650
So I have, the column is 24,
23, 22, 23, 23, 22, 25.

17
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.110
Same one we did a visualization up here.

18
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.542
Now we can take the same column sf.age and
do some computations on it.

19
00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:26.776
So if you type .mean, it's not
saying that column is a mean column,

20
00:01:26.776 --> 00:01:31.210
but actually computing
the mean of that column.

21
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.210
Which, the mean age is 23.142857,
and so on.

22
00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.976
Now, we can compute, for
example the max age.

23
00:01:39.976 --> 00:01:45.629
So, as of age, and let's see max.

24
00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:52.310
And again you get 25, that's maximum age.

25
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.164
Now, this is some prequel stuff,
but let's do more.

26
00:01:56.164 --> 00:02:02.305
Let's create new columns.

27
00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:10.316
In our SFrame.

28
00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:16.670
So, when you're doing machine learning,
often taking columns

29
00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.910
and transforming them, creating new ones,
this is called feature engineering.

30
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:22.412
We will do a bunch of those.

31
00:02:22.412 --> 00:02:24.914
I'm gonna do now,
a creation of a new column.

32
00:02:24.914 --> 00:02:27.118
So, let's go back and
print the SFrame, and

33
00:02:27.118 --> 00:02:30.930
you see that there's a First Name
column and there's a Last Name column.

34
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.887
There's no full name column.

35
00:02:31.887 --> 00:02:34.951
Let's say you want to create a new
full name column, it's pretty easy.

36
00:02:34.951 --> 00:02:38.175
I wanna say sf,
our SFrame of Full Name, so

37
00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:41.590
there's gonna be a column
called Full Name.

38
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.160
And what is that column equal to?

39
00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.049
Well, it's just a concatenation
of first name and last name.

40
00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.302
And in Python, it's really easy to take
strings and concatenate them together.

41
00:02:52.302 --> 00:02:53.591
All you have to do is put a plus sign.

42
00:02:53.591 --> 00:02:58.370
So we can do sf['Full Name'] is gonna be

43
00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.814
the First Name column, so ['First Name'],

44
00:03:03.814 --> 00:03:08.857
and then I'm gonna put a space between it,
so

45
00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:13.808
plus the space, plus the last name column.

46
00:03:13.808 --> 00:03:18.410
So, Last Name.

47
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.850
Now, this is pretty cool.

48
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.980
I just create a new feature, new column,

49
00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.310
called full name which is just
the first name space last name.

50
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.840
It's very easy to do
these things in Python,

51
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.590
especially if you don't have typos.

52
00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.920
I see that this is Fist Name
instead of First Name.

53
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.981
So, and there you go.

54
00:03:33.981 --> 00:03:37.468
So, now if you go back and
show the SFrame again,

55
00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:43.380
you'll see there is a new column called
Full Name has been placed at the end.

56
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.683
So Bob Smith is the first full name there.

57
00:03:46.683 --> 00:03:49.830
Now, you can do all sorts
of interesting things.

58
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.392
So, for
example you could take the age column and

59
00:03:54.392 --> 00:03:57.850
I'm not gonna create a new problem.

60
00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.800
I'm just gonna do add 2
here to this age column.

61
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.100
And you'll see that it's just
gonna add 2 to every element.

62
00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.030
And so,
you can do these kinds of operations.

63
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.081
For example, you can do age and

64
00:04:11.081 --> 00:04:18.010
multiply it by the column age again.

65
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.860
Now what happens when you do that?

66
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.580
Age times age?

67
00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:23.262
You're gonna get age
squared in every element.

68
00:04:23.262 --> 00:04:25.653
And you get 556, 529 and so on.

69
00:04:25.653 --> 00:04:29.679
