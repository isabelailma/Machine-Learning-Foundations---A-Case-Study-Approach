2
00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:06.544
So that's how we do various
transformations of our data.

3
00:00:06.544 --> 00:00:10.190
But these are very simple
mathematical operations.

4
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.450
Let's do an advanced data transformation.

5
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.183
So we're gonna use what's called

6
00:00:20.183 --> 00:00:26.112
the apply function to do a kind of a,

7
00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:30.263
let's call it a advanced

8
00:00:30.263 --> 00:00:35.220
transformation of our data.

9
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.286
So this is going to be pretty cool.

10
00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:44.990
So we're gonna use it to
define a new function,

11
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.910
we're gonna do a bunch of things here.

12
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.415
So here's what I wanna do,
we're gonna look at the column country.

13
00:00:53.415 --> 00:00:57.650
Let's just say there's
a little bug in my data set.

14
00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.100
Some people's country United States.

15
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.787
And some people country is USA,

16
00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:06.850
some people country is United States, so
if you just view the [INAUDIBLE] model

17
00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.366
they will think USA is a different
country from the United States.

18
00:01:10.366 --> 00:01:12.120
And you wanna make sure
that it's the same country.

19
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.681
So I am gonna take everywhere it says USA
and substitute that with United States.

20
00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:19.650
So we get different counts.

21
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.303
So right now for example,

22
00:01:23.303 --> 00:01:27.570
if I do sf of country dot show.

23
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.154
So if I just show that you will see
that United States has two counts and

24
00:01:33.154 --> 00:01:36.190
USA has one count over here.

25
00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.700
And that's kind of a problematic thing.

26
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.790
So let's fix that.

27
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.710
So the first thing I'm gonna do
is create the function that,

28
00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.380
if the input is United States,
USA would change to United States.

29
00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.610
So let's define a function,

30
00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.135
we talked about how to define a function
I'm gonna call it transform_country.

31
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.610
And it takes me to import a country and

32
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.970
you put a colon in the end, press Enter
and you have to align things vertically.

33
00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:19.200
So it says,
if the country is equal to USA,

34
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.370
then we're gonna return United States.

35
00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.100
So this way we normalize the data.

36
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.100
Else, so if it's not United States,
we don't do anything.

37
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.741
So we just return the country as it was.

38
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:41.050
So we created this function
transform country, so

39
00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.940
we can now execute that action.

40
00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.100
So let me just show you
what happens as an example.

41
00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:52.010
So if I compute transform_country and
give it input Brazil, it returns Brazil.

42
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.930
It doesn't do anything.

43
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.650
And in fact,
[LAUGH] if I get it input Brasil.

44
00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:58.962
We say Brasil.

45
00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:03.210
And it has an S, not a Z,
also returns with an S.

46
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.747
This is a normalize between
the English version of Brazil and

47
00:03:06.747 --> 00:03:08.860
the Portuguese version of Brasil.

48
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.320
But if you give as input,
transfer country USA,

49
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.800
you'll see that it returns United States.

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.370
So it's gonna fix that kind of mistake.

51
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.816
Now, what I wanna do is go line
by line in my data set and

52
00:03:24.816 --> 00:03:33.190
whenever I see the word United States in
the country column, I wanna change that.

53
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.930
So USA in the country column,
it changed to United States.

54
00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.040
So I wanna apply this transform_country
to every row of the data.

55
00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.012
And you could create a for loop,
and that could be kind of annoying.

56
00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:45.276
And this is where the apply
function comes in.

57
00:03:45.276 --> 00:03:47.458
So here's what I'm gonna do.

58
00:03:47.458 --> 00:03:52.880
I'm going to run a function
on the country column.

59
00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.007
And what apply does it takes
this function transform

60
00:03:58.007 --> 00:04:05.050
country that we defined transform
country and apply it row by row.

61
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.100
Let's see what the output would be.

62
00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.130
So if I run it row by row it says,
it prints some statistics, but

63
00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:15.010
it says, United States, Canada, England,
United States Poland, United States.

64
00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.900
So all the USAs changed to United States.

65
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:22.280
And now, what I could do is say,
I wanna take my country column,

66
00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.250
and I'm gonna fix it by saying, take
what it used to be, the country column,

67
00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:35.920
and apply this transformation
to every single line,

68
00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.720
and just store it back
into the country column.

69
00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.230
And now, if you look at our SFrame,
you'll see that you have United States.

70
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.890
No USA in this column.

71
00:04:48.705 --> 00:04:52.075
Great.
So we've seen how to create functions,

72
00:04:52.075 --> 00:04:55.055
how to transform some columns,
how to create new columns with SFrames.

73
00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:57.295
and how to show our data.

74
00:04:57.295 --> 00:05:00.603
Now, this tools GraphLab I'm creating
in SFrame is what we're gonna be using

75
00:05:00.603 --> 00:05:03.155
throughout this course.

76
00:05:03.155 --> 00:05:06.538
And you will see many ways of applying it,
and using it, and

77
00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:10.124
it's gonna make it really easy
to build some of the intelligent

78
00:05:10.124 --> 00:05:13.458
applications that we're
building in this first course.

79
