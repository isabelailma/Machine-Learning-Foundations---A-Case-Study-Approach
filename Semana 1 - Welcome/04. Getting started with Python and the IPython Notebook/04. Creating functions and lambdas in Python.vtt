2
00:00:03.727 --> 00:00:08.908
So, hopefully this gets you started
with Python, the programming language

3
00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:13.700
with the iPython Notebook, and
a little bit of iterating the console.

4
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:17.560
We're gonna be using this console
again and again, it's really a fun,

5
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.230
simple way to manage and
interact with data.

6
00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:24.430
And there's also tools for
visualizing, for navigating, for

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.150
doing machine learning
in this Python space.

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.240
So, it's really a great
programming language for us.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.590
And, in fact,
there's been a lot of surveys

10
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.510
that say most recently Python is the
programming language for data science and

11
00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.759
that's why we picked it for this course.

12
00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.270
As a final step, let's talk about
creating functions in Python.

13
00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.600
It's actually pretty easy to create a wide
range of functions within Python and

14
00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.700
it's pretty natural.

15
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.230
So there's two ways of doing it.

16
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.610
So let's go ahead and get started.

17
00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.967
So, again ask m for a text box and

18
00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:04.938
we're gonna talk about

19
00:01:04.938 --> 00:01:10.308
creating functions in Python.

20
00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:16.490
Okay, so
the first way is using the def command.

21
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.369
So this is defining a function,
let's say a fun function,

22
00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.770
add 2 which takes an element x and
adds 2 to it.

23
00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.910
So we write def add2, and in parenthesis,
you put the number of parameters you have,

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.280
there is this x, you could have x,
y, z, and so on.

25
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.190
And then you put a colon at the end.

26
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.625
And just like with flukes,
we want to align in vertically,

27
00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:44.450
kinda tabulated, until we've written
out all the function we want to do.

28
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:50.210
So for example,
we could say y is equal to x

29
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.960
plus 2, and then we say return y.

30
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.190
So here we defined a function add 2.

31
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.740
So let's, remember integer value i,
let's just set it to some number,

32
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.995
let's say we say that i is equal to 5,
and we say

33
00:02:07.995 --> 00:02:14.790
add 2 with the input i and we get 7.

34
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.290
Voila.

35
00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.030
The second way to define functions is
using what Python calls lambda's, and

36
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.600
these are for simple functions and
it's useful to know it.

37
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.770
It's used in a variety of places where
you just do a simple transformation,

38
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.680
even add to is a simple transformation so
for example,

39
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.820
let's create a function called square.

40
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.778
So this is the square function,

41
00:02:44.778 --> 00:02:53.350
which is a lambda that takes into
input x and returns x times x.

42
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.500
So if I read this to you when defining
a function, this land is a function,

43
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.680
takes x's input and returns x times x.

44
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.850
That's what it tells us after the column.

45
00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.300
So we defined that and now we can
apply square to anything we want, so

46
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.280
for example.

47
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.370
If we say what is the square of 3,
it should say 9 and

48
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.590
there we go,
two ways to define functions in Python.

49
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.054
Now we have the grasps of Python's basics,
they can used for

50
00:03:23.054 --> 00:03:27.949
all assignments we're gonna be
building up in this first course.

51
00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.879
