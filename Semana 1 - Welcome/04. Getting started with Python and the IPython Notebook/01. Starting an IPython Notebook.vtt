2
00:00:04.238 --> 00:00:07.688
>> Today we're going to talk about
two really exciting tools for

3
00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:12.680
programming machine learning algorithms,
and also useful in data science.

4
00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.830
One is the Python programming language,
and

5
00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.470
the other one is what's
called the iPython Notebook.

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.230
At this point, I'll assume that you have
already installed Python in your system.

7
00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.770
You've gone through those
steps of installation.

8
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.770
And now I'm just gonna go over
a few tips to get started.

9
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.760
There's lots and lots of resources
available online for you to explore and

10
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.500
familiarize yourself with all
the techniques that you need to do.

11
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.110
But really, I think it would be fun for
us to go over this together,

12
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.780
since this is a really,
really useful tool.

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.000
And something that makes
a tremendous difference in practice.

14
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.150
When you first call iPython Notebook,
you are faced with something like this.

15
00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.440
It's basically a version
of your directory,

16
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.260
with all the files in the directory.

17
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.300
There's some data files that I have,
as well as some

18
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:00.920
iPython Notebooks I have created
earlier and some other data net file.

19
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.110
This is more like a file browser.

20
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:06.280
So what we're gonna do is
start a whole new notebook.

21
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.230
So I am gonna go New, Python 2,

22
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.820
since we're gonna have a notebook
that is a Python notebook.

23
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.000
And welcome this is iPython notebook.

24
00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:16.970
This store is gonna run for

25
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.000
a few years now and has really changed
how we build machine learning and

26
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.335
data science algorithms and
how we communicate with others.

27
00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:28.890
It's a really useful tool.

28
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.080
It blends two things that I love, Python,

29
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.770
a simple scripting programming
language with Wiki pages,

30
00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.440
things which make it reasonably
easy to communicate with others.

31
00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.230
So, Python plus Wiki pages
is the iPython notebook.

32
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.810
So today I'm gonna both show
you the iPython Notebook and

33
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.650
also gonna show you some tips and
tricks in Python just to get started,

34
00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.430
assuming that you can program in Python or
in other programming languages.

35
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.830
So you've run IPython Notebook and
you started a fresh new one.

36
00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.710
Let me just walk you over the interface.

37
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.810
So at the very top here is
the title of the notebook.

38
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.350
And we're going to change
it to something else.

39
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.978
So I'm going to change
it to Getting Started

40
00:02:11.978 --> 00:02:19.549
with iPython Notebook.

41
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.840
And there you go.

42
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.260
We have a new notebook,
and that's the title.

43
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.120
And so this notebook is kind
of like a console for Python.

44
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.450
But also it allows you to save the pages
that you generate, and include text and

45
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.180
images in that.

46
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.660
And we're gonna play with all
of that during this course,

47
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.340
because it's really useful.

48
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.380
It has a menu here that
allows you to do things like

49
00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.685
save the file that you have and
load a new one, edit, copy,

50
00:02:45.685 --> 00:02:49.760
add new cells, and
we're gonna talk about those soon.

51
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.140
But let's just get started.

52
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.660
So let's get started with Python.

53
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.720
I want to click on one of the cells, which
is kind of like an entry in a console.

54
00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.700
And I'm going to type my
first Python function.

55
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.050
So the first function I'm
going to do is just print.

56
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.820
So I'm going to print a string and
strings in Python can be single quotes or

57
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.980
double quotes, is up to you.

58
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.750
And the string I'm going to
print is the famous hello world.

59
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.150
And when I press Shift-Enter,
it executes a cell so

60
00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.050
you have to remember to press Shift-Enter.

61
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.040
We'll talk about pressing
just Enter in a second.

62
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.320
And after executing, it says Hello World.

63
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:35.630
So now,
let's take a ride on iPython Notebook and

64
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:41.800
some of the Python functions that we're
interested in using during these courses.

65
00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:46.590
So the first piece of iPython Notebook
is that you can include text, and

66
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.180
really well-formatted text, so
there's two ways of accessing text cells.

67
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.862
So the first one is to
go over here to cell,

68
00:03:56.862 --> 00:04:00.950
cell type and call it markdown.

69
00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.930
And then you click on it and
you can start writing.

70
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.630
And it's really a mark down
language kind of like Wikipages.

71
00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.976
So if I put a pound here,
I can do a header,

72
00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:14.370
#Getting started with Python.

73
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.470
Oops.
And now instead of pressing Shift+Enter,

74
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.400
we press regular Enter,
it gives you a multiline cell.

75
00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:23.450
So Enter.

76
00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:25.050
Let's get started with Python.

77
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.412
And let's do a sub-header now.

78
00:04:27.412 --> 00:04:31.318
The first thing we're gonna assume
is what you have done so far.

79
00:04:31.318 --> 00:04:38.251
So we have done the following.

80
00:04:38.251 --> 00:04:40.360
So just press enter.

81
00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.030
Here's a list.

82
00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.094
We've done, we've installed Python,

83
00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:49.936
the Python programming language.

84
00:04:49.936 --> 00:04:54.906
We've started

85
00:04:54.906 --> 00:05:01.413
iPython Notebook.

86
00:05:01.413 --> 00:05:02.810
And okay.

87
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.650
So that did not work so well.

88
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.510
Okay.
I executed it, it's not quite right.

89
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.920
Let me see what I forgot, so
I can double-click on it and edit.

90
00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.910
I forgot to put a space here.

91
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.920
So Space between the different lines.

92
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.240
So we install iPython, and

93
00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.250
we start the iPython Notebook,
this is what we have done so far.

94
00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.044
And now if I press Shift + Enter,
and you can see now we have a list.

95
00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:30.299
