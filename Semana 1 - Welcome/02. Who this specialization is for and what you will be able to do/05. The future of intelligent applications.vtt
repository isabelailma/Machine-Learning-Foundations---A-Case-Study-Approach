2
00:00:04.003 --> 00:00:07.894
Okay, so it's a really exciting time to
do a machine learning specialization,

3
00:00:07.894 --> 00:00:11.510
because we see machine learning
everywhere in our everyday lives.

4
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.970
So for example, Carlos is always
on my case that I'm on my phone.

5
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.070
So I turn on my phone and there
are a lot of smart applications on here.

6
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.890
And there are things that
are personalized to me as a user.

7
00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.485
>> And they're all using a machine
learning at their core, which is exciting.

8
00:00:27.485 --> 00:00:31.230
Today, every time you go to a website,
most likely there's a machine learning

9
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.130
algorithm behind the scenes, analyzing
the data, analyzing interactions and

10
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.680
really changing your experience
using machine learning.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.110
And we're see that in
a wide range of settings.

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.650
>> Yeah, so not just on my phone.

13
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.050
One device that Carlos
loves is this thing.

14
00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:46.700
>> It's a wearable device.

15
00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.340
It tracks my activity.

16
00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.060
Analyzes my sleep.

17
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.620
Analyzes my exercise routines.

18
00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.310
Helps with what I'm doing.

19
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.095
And really takes the data, understands it,

20
00:00:58.095 --> 00:01:03.020
then helps me look at how my health is
evolving over time, which is pretty cool.

21
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.140
>> So that's why it's exciting to
think about machine learning now.

22
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.945
But, of course,

23
00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:11.360
there's a lot more that machine learning
has the possibility of doing in our lives.

24
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.436
>> You can see the world
changing with self-driving cars,

25
00:01:15.436 --> 00:01:19.410
with personalized medicine,
with interactive things where

26
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.310
you've got sensors everywhere,
with smart systems everywhere.

27
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:25.870
So in this specialization,

28
00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:28.780
you're going to learn the fundamentals
to all of those things.

29
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.890
In fact, after this specialization,
you will be future ready, future proof.

30
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.710
>> Future proof.

31
00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.920
You'll be futurized.

32
00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.544
>> You'll be the future
of machine learning.

33
00:01:39.544 --> 00:01:42.990
[LAUGH]
>> You are the future.

34
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.170
And that is cool.

35
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.840
>> And that is cool, and

36
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.400
in fact, you are the future because
we recorded this in the past.

37
00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.590
So it's actually true,
and that is also cool.

38
00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.980
Clearly Carlos is still watching and
reading, mainly watching, too much sci-fi.

39
00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:58.900
>> Yeah, did you see the last...

40
00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.340
>> You are in the future.

41
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.670
Welcome.
>> Did you see the latest

42
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.550
season of Doctor Who?

43
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.670
Prequel.
>> [LAUGH]

44
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.430
>> Anyway.

45
00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:08.420
>> On that note, this is cool.

46
00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.560
>> And it's going to be
a really cool specialization.

47
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.080
>> You're supposed to say it is cool.

48
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.632
>> It is cool.

49
00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:12.754
>> [LAUGH]
>> It's going to be a really

50
00:02:12.754 --> 00:02:13.960
cool specialization.

51
00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.310
And let's get started.

52
00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.807
