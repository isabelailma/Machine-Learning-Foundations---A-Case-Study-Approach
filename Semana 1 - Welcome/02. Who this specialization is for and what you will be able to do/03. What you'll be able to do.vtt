[MUSIC].

2
00:00:03.843 --> 00:00:07.128
Now that you've seen what this
course is going to be about,

3
00:00:07.128 --> 00:00:09.427
as well as the specialization as a whole,

4
00:00:09.427 --> 00:00:13.345
you'll see that be able to do amazing
things using machine learning.

5
00:00:13.345 --> 00:00:16.790
Build really intelligent applications,
as you go through this process,

6
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.820
not just at the end, but
throughout the whole specialization.

7
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.050
You'll be building cool, cool stuff, and

8
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.230
you'll be learning about a wide range
of concepts and building the algorithm.

9
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.110
So the first course is really
about using those pre-built

10
00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.420
machine learning algorithms to build
a range of intelligent applications.

11
00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.531
Now, the follow up courses,
the second through the fifth,

12
00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:41.680
takes the different areas and really goes
in depth, talk about the algorithms,

13
00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.230
the methods, the techniques behind it.

14
00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.630
Now let's go back and
talk about the capstone.

15
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:47.980
The capstone is gonna be real exiting.

16
00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.260
You're gonna build a really cool,

17
00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.760
impressive application that
uses machine learning.

18
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.859
