2
00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.572
Let's take a little pause and

3
00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:09.160
spend some time talking about who
the specialization is geared for.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:15.468
Well, the first thing I want to emphasize
is the level of the specialization.

5
00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:19.370
And what we're going to do here
is we're going to teach you

6
00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.210
really important machine learning methods,
but we're going to ground them in

7
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.090
real world applications like
we saw with our case studies.

8
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.430
So a model that we have here is tough
concepts made intuitive and applicable.

9
00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:35.895
So this course isn't going
to be about theorem proving.

10
00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.920
It's going to be about understanding
at a very intuitive and

11
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.630
practical level some very important
machine learning algorithms and

12
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.790
thinking about ways in which to
deploy them in new problems.

13
00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.140
And when we're going about this, our
goals here are to minimize the amount of

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.550
prerequisite knowledge that you have to
have to understand what we're presenting,

15
00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.990
while maximizing the ability for
you to actually develop and

16
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:08.300
deploy these methods on new problems
that are of interest to you.

17
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.940
And when we're thinking about this,
we're going to be presenting concepts

18
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.010
at this very intuitive level that's
grounded in these case studies.

19
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.450
So who might you be?

20
00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.830
Well, when we're thinking
about the target audience,

21
00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.370
we're thinking about software engineers
who are interested in machine learning.

22
00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.270
We're thinking about scientists who
might want to become data scientists.

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.960
And we're thinking about lots and lots and
lots of other people who have some math,

24
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.000
some programming experience, and
want to be able to analyze data and

25
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.230
do fun things with it, so just data
enthusiasts who want to learn more about

26
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.150
machine learning and
how to derive intelligence from data.

27
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.890
Okay.

28
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.050
So I said that we're assuming
you have some math and

29
00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.020
some programming background, so let's talk
about this in a little bit more detail.

30
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.500
In terms of the math background,

31
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.560
we're assuming that you have
some basic calculus knowledge.

32
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.080
So that's understanding
the notion of derivatives and

33
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.740
how they're computed and
basic linear algebra.

34
00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.780
So you guys should know what a vector is,
what a matrix is, and

35
00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.880
how to multiply matrices.

36
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.600
But in these cases, we're really as

37
00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.630
often as possible going to present
things at the most intuitive level.

38
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.640
Even if we could write down an equation in
terms of matrices and matrix multiplies,

39
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.050
we're going to try and add as many visual
aids as possible to provide you with that

40
00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.010
intuition, so that if you're only
marginally comfortable with these ideas,

41
00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.370
I do suggest that you go
brush up on these concepts.

42
00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.590
But, again, we're going to try and

43
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.750
provide the intuition that we
described as part of our motto.

44
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.405
And in terms of programming experience,

45
00:02:52.405 --> 00:03:00.780
in this specialization we're going to
be using Basic Python for programing.

46
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.730
But if you're not familiar with Python,
it would, of course,

47
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.200
be helpful if you were
familiar with Basic Python.

48
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.660
But we think that you can pick up on
the important tools that you'll need

49
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.750
if you have some other knowledge
of some other language.

50
00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.280
Okay.
So finally,

51
00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.250
what are your computing needs for
this course?

52
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.200
Well, we're going to assume that you
have some basic desktop or laptop or

53
00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.610
access to one where you
can access the Internet.

54
00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.120
Of course, that's important so
you can watch these lovely videos, but

55
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.310
beyond that so
you can do your assignments.

56
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.040
And to do your assignments, you're
going to need to be able to install and

57
00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.530
run Python.

58
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.600
And in addition, you're going to be able,

59
00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.440
you're going to have to be able
to store a few gigabytes of data.

60
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:51.070
Okay.
So

61
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.530
that basically summarizes what we have in
mind for who this specialization is for.

62
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.076
And we hope that fits your case.

63
00:03:57.076 --> 00:04:01.229
